# Vinyl Cutter
A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like a desktop printer. Like a printer controls a nozzle, the computer controls the movement of a sharp blade over the surface of the material. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl). The vinyl can then be stuck to a variety of surfaces depending on the adhesive and type of material.

To cut out a design a vector-based image must be created in a software program (usually Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw). It is then sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable. Since the vinyl material comes in long rolls, projects with significant length like banners or billboards can be easily cut as well.

The one major limitation with vinyl cutters is that they can only cut shapes from solid colours of vinyl. A design with multiple colours must have each colour cut separately and then layered on top of each other as it is applied to the substrate. Also, since the shapes are cut out of solid colours, photographs and gradients cannot be reproduced with a stand alone cutter.

In addition to the capabilities of the cutter itself, the adhesive vinyl comes in a wide variety of colours and materials including gold and silver foil, vinyl that simulates frosted glass, holographic vinyl, reflective vinyl, thermal transfer material, and even clear vinyl imbedded with gold leaf. (Often used in the lettering on fire trucks and rescue vehicles.

### Installing a Blade
- Insert a pin into the blade holder.
- Insert a blade into the blade holder
- Loosen the screw shown in the figure.
- While supporting the screw from below, insert into the blade holder from above.
- Tighten the screw securely.
- Tug the blade holder upward to make sure it does not come loose.

### Loading the Material
- Pass the end of the material between the pinch rollers and the grit rollers so that it extends from the front of the unit.
- Position the material so that both edges are above the grit rollers.
- Align so that the left and right edges of the material 
- Using the stickers on the rails as a guide, adjust the positioning of the left and right pinch rollers above the grit rollers.are parallel with the guide lines.
- Make sure the end of the material has been pulled out farther toward the front than the blade protector.
- Raise the sheet loading lever. This lowers the pinch rollers to hold the material in place.

### Setting the Origin Point
- Before setting the origin point, load the material.
- Use the position keys to move the center of the blade holder to the location where you want to set the origin point.
- Press the ORIGIN key. The message ORIGIN SETTING flashes on the display, and the origin point is set.
