The Fab Lab in Bhubaneswar will be hosted at STPI’s newly inaugurated facility ‘STPI Elite’. The innovative lab will see an investment of Rs 60-70 million to be shared by the Odisha government and STPI equally. The funds have been already for sanctioned for the projects.

Sprawling across three acres of land, the state-of-the-art building of STPI will house next generation incubation facility, fabrication lab in ESDM Incubation & data centre to cater the need of the IT (information technology) ITes (enabled services) and ESDM (electronics system design & manufacturing) industries.

STPI has a significant presence in Odisha. It has eight centres in the state, the highest among all states. While four centres are already operational, the balance is yet to come up.
